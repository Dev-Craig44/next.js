here I'm going to learn
-define dynamic routes
-access route and query string parameters
-create layouts
-show loading UIs
-handle errors

-to make a route publicly accessible we have to put a special page in that folder

special files

- page.tsx (that next.js router looks for)
- layout.tsx (defining a common layout for all pages in the folder)
- loading.tsx (for showing loading UIs)
- route.tsx (creating API routes)
- not-found.tsx (for showing custom arrows)
- error.tsx (for showing genereal custom errors)
